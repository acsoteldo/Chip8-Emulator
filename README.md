## Chip8-Emulator
* Implement the CPU. The CPU is responsible for executing Chip-8 instructions, so this is an important part of the emulator. You'll need to write code to fetch and decode instructions, and then execute them.

* Implement the memory system. Chip-8 has a simple memory system consisting of 4096 bytes of RAM. You'll need to write code to read and write to this memory, as well as to load programs into memory.

* Implement the graphics system. Chip-8 has a simple graphics system that uses a 64x32 pixel display. You'll need to write code to draw graphics on the screen and handle basic graphics operations like clearing the screen and setting pixels.

* Implement the input system. Chip-8 has a simple input system that uses a hexadecimal keypad for input. You'll need to write code to handle input from the keypad and map it to the appropriate actions in your emulator.
